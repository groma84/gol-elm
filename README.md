# Conway's Game of Life in Elm
After messing around with [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) at the Global Day of Code Retreat 2017 at [Mathema](https://www.mathema.de) I decided to implement the full game at least once.
And to learn something new I decided to do it in [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/).

The code probably isn't very idiomatic Elm or elegant yet, but we all have to start somewhere :-)
